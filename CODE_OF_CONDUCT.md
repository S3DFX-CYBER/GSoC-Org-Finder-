# Code of Conduct

We are committed to a welcoming, harassment‑free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio‑economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:
- Showing empathy and kindness to other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Using inclusive language and considering accessibility

Examples of unacceptable behavior:
- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination in any form
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment, including unwelcome sexual attention
- Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Scope

This Code applies within all project spaces (Issues, PRs, discussions, review comments) and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers. To report, please use one of the following:
- Email: saviodsouza8a@gmail.com
- Or contact `@S3DFX-CYBER` privately on GitHub

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter.

## Enforcement guidelines

- Correction: Community impact is minor — a private, written warning with clarity around expected behavior.
- Warning: A violation through a single incident or series of actions — a warning with consequences for continued behavior.
- Temporary Ban: A serious violation or repeated behavior — temporary restriction from interaction and contribution.
- Permanent Ban: Demonstrated pattern of violation or severe harassment — permanent restriction from community spaces.
