# Contributing Guide

## Program-Specific Guides

If you are contributing under a specific program, refer to the dedicated guide for your track:

| Track | Guide |
|-------|-------|
| GSSoC'26 Contributors | [GSSoC Contributor Guide](docs/GSSOC_CONTRIBUTOR_GUIDE.md) |
| GSSoC'26 Mentors | [GSSoC Mentor Guide](docs/GSSOC_MENTOR_GUIDE.md) |
| NSoC'26 Contributors | [NSoC Guide](docs/NSOC_GUIDE.md) |

The rest of this document covers the shared rules, architecture, and workflow that apply to **all** contributors regardless of program.

## Project Philosophy

This repository follows a **zero-build, zero-dependency** philosophy.

### Principles

- No build tools
- No unnecessary dependencies
- Minimal runtime overhead
- Simple, readable, maintainable code
- Fast client-side performance
- Minimal API usage wherever possible

When contributing, avoid introducing libraries, frameworks, bundlers, or unnecessary abstractions unless they are clearly justified.

---

## Architecture

The project is built using **Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript + Vercel Edge Functions**.

### Core Stack

| Layer     | Technology                  |
|-----------|-----------------------------|
| Frontend  | Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS         |
| Hosting   | Vercel                      |
| Backend   | Vercel Edge Functions       |
| Data      | Static JSON + GitHub API    |
| Analytics | localStorage only           |

### Architecture Goals

- Lightweight runtime
- No build process
- Edge-compatible APIs
- Fast initial page load
- Fully static-first deployment

All contributions should remain compatible with the existing architecture.

---

## Local Development

### Install Vercel CLI

```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

### Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/S3DFX-CYBER/GSoC-Org-Finder-.git
cd GSoC-Org-Finder-
```

### Run Local Development Server

```bash
vercel dev
```

This simulates the Vercel Edge runtime locally.

## How to Start Contributing

### Step 1 — Find an Issue

Go to the repository **Issues** tab and filter using labels:

- `level-1`
- `level-2`
- `level-3`
- `gssoc26`
- `nsoc26`

---

### Step 2 — Request Assignment

Comment **ONE** of the following:

```
/assign
```

or

```
assign me
```

---

### Step 3 — Wait for Bot Validation

The assignment bot automatically validates:

- Issue quality
- Duplicate/spam detection
- Contributor eligibility
- Active issue count
- Contribution program
- Level restrictions

> **Do NOT start work before assignment.**

---

## 🤖 Smart Assignment System

This repository uses automated contributor management workflows.

### Supported Commands

| Command      | Action              |
|--------------|---------------------|
| `/assign`    | Request assignment  |
| `assign me`  | Request assignment  |
| `/unassign`  | Remove assignment   |
| `unassign me`| Remove assignment   |

---

## 📌 Program Declaration

Contributors should mention their contribution track when requesting assignment:

- **GSSoC** — GirlScript Summer of Code participants
- **NSoC** — Nexus Spring of Code participants
- **General** — Independent contributors (no program affiliation)

**Examples:**

> I want to work on this issue under GSSoC.

> I would like to contribute under NSOC.

> I would like to work on this issue as a general contributor.

General contributors do not need to declare a program but must still follow the assignment process.

---

## ⏳ GSSoC Assignment Restriction

> **Important**

GSSoC issue assignments are only allowed after:

**15 May 2026 — 12:00 AM IST**

Before that time:

- GSSoC contributors cannot claim issues
- The bot will automatically reject assignment attempts
- Contributors will receive an automated reminder message

NSoC contributors are unaffected.

---

## 🧠 Automatic Issue Validation

The repository automatically detects and blocks:

- Duplicate issues
- AI-slop issues
- Spam reports
- Copied template spam
- Prompt leakage
- Meaningless low-quality issues
- Bot-generated issue spam

Issues may be automatically:

- Labeled
- Closed
- Redirected to original issues

---

## 🚫 Self-Assignment Restriction

Do **NOT** self-assign issues using the GitHub UI.

Assignments are handled **ONLY** through the automation workflow.

Manual self-assignment may be removed automatically.

---

## 📌 Maximum Active Assignments

To maintain fairness, contributors may only hold:

> **Maximum 3 assigned issues at once**

The assignment bot automatically checks this. If you already have 3 active issues, new assignments will be rejected until progress is made.

---

## 🔄 PR Consolidation Rule

Contributors are encouraged to combine:

- 1–2 related fixes
- Small connected improvements

into a **single focused PR** instead of opening many tiny PRs.

Low-effort PR spam may be rejected.

---

## ✍️ Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

This repository enforces the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO).

By submitting a contribution, you certify that:

- You wrote the code/content yourself, or
- You have the legal right to contribute it

Every commit must be signed off.

### How to sign commits

Use:

```bash
git commit -s -m "feat: add search improvements"
```
---
## 🔕 Maintainer Ping Policy

Please avoid repeatedly pinging maintainers for:
- issue assignment
- PR reviews
- label updates
- merge requests
- priority escalation

Maintainers review contributions in queue order whenever possible.

Excessive pinging, spam comments, or DM requests may result in:
- comment deletion
- temporary assignment removal
- spam labeling for repeated abuse

Please allow reasonable review time before following up.

Recommended wait times:
- Issue assignment: 12–24 hours
- PR review: 24–72 hours

---

## Assignment Priority Policy

Commenting first does not reserve or guarantee assignment ownership.

If another eligible contributor claims the issue earlier, the assignment may be granted to them instead.

---

## ❌ Strictly Prohibited

The following may result in rejection or disqualification:

- AI-generated PRs without understanding
- Fake complexity

- Multiple tiny PRs
- Copied contributions
- Template spam

- Opening duplicate PRs/issues
- Unnecessary dependency additions

---

## ✅ What Makes a Good Contribution

Strong contributions usually include:

- Meaningful bug fixes
- Useful features
- Performance improvements
- Accessibility improvements
- Maintainable refactors
- High-quality documentation improvements
- Responsive/mobile improvements
- Testing improvements

Before opening a PR ask:

> Does this meaningfully improve the project?

---

## 🔗 Linking Issues is Mandatory
