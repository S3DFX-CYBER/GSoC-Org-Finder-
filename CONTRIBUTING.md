## Project Philosophy

This repository follows a:

- Zero-build philosophy
- Minimal dependency philosophy
- Static-first architecture
- Edge-runtime compatible workflow

### Core Principles

- No unnecessary dependencies
- No heavy frameworks
- No bundlers unless absolutely required
- Simple and maintainable code
- Fast runtime performance
- Lightweight APIs
- Edge-compatible architecture
- Human-reviewed contributions over AI-generated spam

Contributors should avoid introducing:

- unnecessary npm packages
- client-side frameworks
- large runtime abstractions
- unnecessary build pipelines
- dependency-heavy tooling

unless clearly justified.

---

## Architecture

The project is built using:

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Frontend | Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS |
| Backend | Vercel Edge Functions |
| Hosting | Vercel |
| Data | Static JSON + GitHub API |
| Analytics | localStorage |

### Architecture Goals

- Fully static-first deployment
- Fast initial page load
- Minimal API overhead
- Edge-compatible runtime
- No hydration complexity
- Maintainable repository structure

---

## Local Development

**Install Vercel CLI**

```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

**Clone Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/S3DFX-CYBER/GSoC-Org-Finder-.git
cd GSoC-Org-Finder-
```

**Start Local Development**

```bash
vercel dev
```

This simulates the Vercel Edge runtime locally.

## How To Start Contributing

### Step 1 — Find an Issue

Go to the **Issues** tab and filter by labels:

- `level:beginner`
- `level:intermediate`
- `level:advanced`
- `type:bug`
- `type:docs`
- `type:ui`
- `type:enhancement`
- `type:api`
- `gssoc26`
- `nsoc26`

Issues are automatically analyzed using repository automation.

The triage system:

- categorizes difficulty
- detects duplicates
- identifies spam
- labels issue type
- flags low-quality reports

---

## Assignment Workflow

This repository uses a **mentor-assisted assignment pipeline**.

> Assignments are **NOT** handled manually through the GitHub UI.  
> All issue assignment requests are processed through repository automation.

### Requesting Assignment

To request an issue, comment:

```
/assign
```

> Do **NOT** self-assign using the GitHub interface.

---

### Mentor-Based Assignment Queue

When a contributor requests assignment:

1. The request is queued automatically
2. Two active mentors are randomly selected from the mentor activity pool
3. The mentors are notified on the issue
4. Mentors have **24 hours** to approve the assignment
5. If mentors do not respond within 24 hours:
   - Mentors are rotated automatically
   - New active mentors are selected
6. If no mentor approves after timeout:
   - The Project Admin (PA) is notified automatically
   - Manual assignment review begins

#### Mentor Selection System

Mentor selection is:

- Randomized
- Activity-aware
- Weighted toward active mentors
- Dynamically rotated
- Workload balanced

The system avoids repeatedly selecting the same mentors for every issue. Mentors are selected from the active mentor leaderboard and review activity data. Inactive mentors are deprioritized automatically.

---

### Assignment Approval Commands

**Contributors**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/assign` | Request issue assignment |
| `/unassign` | Remove your current assignment |

**Mentors**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/approve-assignment @username` | Approve and assign a contributor |

> Only currently pinged mentors may approve.

---

### Assignment Eligibility

#### Beginner Issues

Anyone may request assignment.

Examples: documentation fixes, UI tweaks, accessibility fixes, simple bug fixes

#### Intermediate Issues

**Requirements:** GitHub account at least 30 days old

Examples: filtering improvements, caching changes, API improvements, search improvements

#### Advanced Issues

**Requirements:** At least 1 merged PR in this repository

Examples: architecture changes, security-sensitive logic, performance optimization, workflow redesign

---

### Maximum Active Assignments

To ensure fairness:

| Program | Maximum Active Issues |
|---------|-----------------------|
| GSSoC | 3 |
| NSoC | 3 |
| General Contributors | 3 |

Requests above the limit are automatically rejected.

---

## Duplicate Issue Detection

The repository includes an **AI-assisted duplicate detection system**.

### How Duplicate Detection Works

The detector compares:

- Normalized issue titles
- Semantic keyword overlap
- Important technical keywords
- Issue intent similarity
- Token overlap scoring

The system intentionally avoids:

- Aggressive exact-title matching
- Weak substring matching
- Low-confidence duplicate flags

The duplicate detector uses:

- Weighted similarity scoring
- Keyword extraction
- Overlap thresholds
- Confidence filtering
- Technical term matching

This significantly reduces false positives.

> Issues are **NOT** auto-closed solely because they are flagged as possible duplicates.

---

## Smart Review Pipeline

Pull requests go through a **3-stage review pipeline**:

| Stage | Reviewer | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Stage 1 | Automation | Validation + anti-spam |
| Stage 2 | Mentors | Code review |
| Stage 3 | Project Admin | Final merge gate |

### Stage 1 — Automated Validation

Automation checks:

- DCO sign-off
- PR formatting
- Issue linking
- Duplicate PR detection
- AI slop detection
- Context validation
- Diff quality
- Repository policy compliance

The repository also uses:

- LLM-assisted PR analysis
- Spam heuristics
- Low-effort detection
- Context validation against linked issues

### Stage 2 — Mentor Review

Once Stage 1 passes:

1. Active mentors are selected automatically
2. Mentors are requested dynamically
3. Review activity is tracked in the mentor leaderboard
4. Review quality scoring is calculated
5. Mentors have **24 hours** to respond
6. Inactive mentors are replaced automatically

#### Mentor Review Quality System

| Review Type | Score |
|-------------|-------|
| Low-effort approval | Low points |
| Detailed review with feedback | Higher points |
| Helpful requested changes | Higher points |
| Merge-quality approval | Highest points |

The mentor leaderboard tracks:

- Reviews completed
- Review quality
- Approvals
- Merged-review count
- Assignment approvals
- Priority review activity

### Mentor Review Leaderboard

The mentor leaderboard:

- Updates automatically
- Tracks all-time review activity
- Includes mentor profile avatars
- Generates visual leaderboard comments
- Updates after PR merges
- Powers mentor assignment weighting

The leaderboard prioritizes: active mentors, high-quality reviewers, and consistent participation.

---

## Contributor Leaderboard

The contributor leaderboard updates automatically after PR merges.

It includes:

- GitHub avatars
- Contributor rankings
- Merged PR counts
- Contribution scores
- Contextual leaderboard comments

Leaderboard comments are posted automatically on merged PRs.

---

## Pull Request Workflow

### Before Opening a PR
